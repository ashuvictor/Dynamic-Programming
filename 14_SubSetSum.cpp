You are given an array/list ‘ARR’ of ‘N’ positive integers and an integer ‘K’. Your task is to check if there exists a subset in ‘ARR’ with a sum equal to ‘K’.
Note: Return true if there exists a subset with sum equal to ‘K’. Otherwise, return false.
For Example :
If ‘ARR’ is {1,2,3,4} and ‘K’ = 4, then there exists 2 subsets with sum = 4. These are {1,3} and {4}. Hence, return true.

The array will have an index but there is one more parameter “target”. We are given the initial problem to find whether there exists in the whole array a subsequence whose sum is equal to the target.

So, we can say that initially, we need to find(n-1, target) which means that we need to find whether there exists a subsequence in the array from index 0 to n-1, whose sum is equal to the target. Similarly, we can generalize it for any index ind as follows:

If target == 0, it means that we have already found the subsequence from the previous steps, so we can return true.
If ind==0, it means we are at the first element, so we need to return arr[ind]==target. If the element is equal to the target we return true else false.

Exclude the current element in the subsequence: We first try to find a subsequence without considering the current index element. For this, we will make a recursive call to f(ind-1,target).
Include the current element in the subsequence: We will try to find a subsequence by considering the current index as element as part of subsequence. As we have included arr[ind], the updated target which we need to find in the rest if the array will be target – arr[ind]. Therefore, we will call f(ind-1,target-arr[ind]).


If we draw the recursion tree, we will see that there are overlapping subproblems. In order to convert a recursive solution the following steps will be taken:

Create a dp array of size [n][k+1]. The size of the input array is ‘n’, so the index will always lie between ‘0’ and ‘n-1’. The target can take any value between ‘0’ and ‘k’. Therefore we take the dp array as dp[n][k+1]
We initialize the dp array to -1.
Whenever we want to find the answer of particular parameters (say f(ind,target)), we first check whether the answer is already calculated using the dp array(i.e dp[ind][target]!= -1 ). If yes, simply return the value from the dp array.
If not, then we are finding the answer for the given value for the first time, we will use the recursive relation as usual but before returning from the function, we will set dp[ind][target] to the solution we get.


#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

bool subsetSumUtil(int ind, int target, vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>> &dp){
    if(target==0)
        return true;
    
    if(ind == 0)
        return arr[0] == target;
    
    if(dp[ind][target]!=-1)
        return dp[ind][target];
        
    bool notTaken = subsetSumUtil(ind-1,target,arr,dp);
    
    bool taken = false;
    if(arr[ind]<=target)
        taken = subsetSumUtil(ind-1,target-arr[ind],arr,dp);
        
    return dp[ind][target]= notTaken||taken;
}

bool subsetSumToK(int n, int k, vector<int> &arr){
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n,vector<int>(k+1,-1));
    
    return subsetSumUtil(n-1,k,arr,dp);
}

int main() {

  vector<int> arr = {1,2,3,4};
  int k=4;
  int n = arr.size();
                                 
  if(subsetSumToK(n,k,arr))
    cout<<"Subset with given target found";
  else 
    cout<<"Subset with given target not found";
}

Output:

Subset with given target found

Time Complexity: O(N*K)

Reason: There are N*K states therefore at max ‘N*K’ new problems will be solved.

Space Complexity: O(N*K) + O(N)

Reason: We are using a recursion stack space(O(N)) and a 2D array ( O(N*K)).

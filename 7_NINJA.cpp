Ninja is planing this ‘N’ days-long training schedule. Each day, he can perform any one of these three activities. (Running, Fighting Practice or Learning New Moves). Each activity has some merit points on each day. As Ninja has to improve all his skills, he can’t do the same activity in two consecutive days. Can you help Ninja find out the maximum merit points Ninja can earn?
You are given a 2D array of size N*3 ‘POINTS’ with the points corresponding to each day and activity. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of merit points that Ninja can earn.
For Example
If the given ‘POINTS’ array is [[1,2,5], [3 ,1 ,1] ,[3,3,3] ],the answer will be 11 as 5 + 3 + 3.


The first approach that comes to our mind is the greedy approach. We will see with an example how a greedy solution doesn’t give the correct solution.
10 50 1
2 100 5

Steps to form the recursive solution: 


Express the problem in terms of indexes.

Now given an example, what is the one clear parameter which breaks the problem in different steps?
It is the number of days. Clearly, we have n days (from 0 to n-1), so one changing parameter which can be expressed in terms of indexes is ‘day’.
Every day we have the option of three activities(say 0,1,2) to be performed. Suppose that we are at a day_i ( shown in the fig) in the example given below. What is one more parameter along with the day that we must know to try out the correct choices at day_i?


Try out all possible choices at a given index.

We are writing a top-down recursive function. We start from day_n-1 to day_0. Therefore whenever we call the recursive function for the next day we call it for f(day-1, //second parameter).
Now let’s discuss the second parameter. The choices we have for a current day depend on the ‘last’ variable. If we are at our base case (day=0), we will have the following choices.





#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int f(int day, int last, vector<vector<int>> &points,vector<vector<int>> &dp) {

  if (dp[day][last] != -1) return dp[day][last];

  if (day == 0) {
    int maxi = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 2; i++) {
      if (i != last)
        maxi = max(maxi, points[0][i]);
    }
    return dp[day][last] = maxi;
  }

  int maxi = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= 2; i++) {
    if (i != last) {
      int activity = points[day][i] + f(day - 1, i, points, dp);
      maxi = max(maxi, activity);
    }

  }

  return dp[day][last] = maxi;
}

int ninjaTraining(int n, vector < vector < int > > & points) {

  vector < vector < int > > dp(n, vector < int > (4, -1));
  return f(n - 1, 3, points, dp);
}

int main() {

  vector < vector < int > > points = {{10,40,70},
                                      {20,50,80},
                                      {30,60,90}};

  int n = points.size();
  cout << ninjaTraining(n, points);
}
Output: 210

Time Complexity: O(N*4*3)

Reason: There are N*4 states and for every state, we are running a for loop iterating three times.

Space Complexity: O(N) + O(N*4)

Reason: We are using a recursion stack space(O(N)) and a 2D array (again O(N*4)). Therefore total space complexity will be O(N) + O(N) ≈ O(N)



Declare a dp[] array of size [n][4]
First initialize the base condition values. We know that base condition arises when day = 0. Therefore, we can say that the following will be the base conditions
dp[0][0] = max(points[0][1], points[0][2]) 
dp[0][1] = max(points[0][0], points[0][2]) 
dp[0][2] = max(points[0][0], points[0][1]) 
dp[0][3] = max(points[0][0], points[0][1] and points[0][2]) 
Set an iterative loop which traverses dp array (from index 1 to n) and for every index set its value according to the recursive logic


#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int ninjaTraining(int n, vector < vector < int > > & points) {

  vector < vector < int > > dp(n, vector < int > (4, 0));

  dp[0][0] = max(points[0][1], points[0][2]);
  dp[0][1] = max(points[0][0], points[0][2]);
  dp[0][2] = max(points[0][0], points[0][1]);
  dp[0][3] = max(points[0][0], max(points[0][1], points[0][2]));

  for (int day = 1; day < n; day++) {
    for (int last = 0; last < 4; last++) {
      dp[day][last] = 0;
      for (int task = 0; task <= 2; task++) {
        if (task != last) {
          int activity = points[day][task] + dp[day - 1][task];
          dp[day][last] = max(dp[day][last], activity);
        }
      }
    }

  }

  return dp[n - 1][3];
}

int main() {

  vector<vector<int> > points = {{10,40,70},
                                 {20,50,80},
                                 {30,60,90}};
  int n = points.size();
  cout << ninjaTraining(n, points);
}


Time Complexity: O(N*4*3)

Reason: There are three nested loops

Space Complexity: O(N*4)

Reason: We are using an external array of size ‘N*4’’.

Mr. X is a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money hidden. 
All houses along this street are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, 
adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
